         I am a project-oriented person so making videos to post online is very fulfilling. 
         I’ve created educational material, music videos, gaming content, and more. 
         Throughout my content creation journey, I’ve picked up skills in video 
         editing, photo editing, script writing, audio balancing, and speech.

      <p class="paragraph">
        I am a competitive person and gaming/esports is my favorite way 
        to scratch that itch. I’ve participated in competitive communities
        in first person shooters and fighting games. More recently, 
        I’ve taken a backseat in competiting and played a larger role 
        in tournament organization, live commentary, and coaching.

              I graduated from the University of Texas at El Paso with a Magna Cum Laude honor. I spent my time at UTEP learning about judicial behavior, law (constitutional and civil liberties), and government. My intention was to proceed to law school after graduation, but I later decided that litigation wasn’t a career that interested me.

            I recently began a software engineering bootcamp at Flatiron School. I am still new to the field, but I hope to transition to a career in Programming in the future.  At Flatiron, I will learn skills in Java Script, CSS, HTML, and more.
