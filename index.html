      <h3>Content Creation</h3>
       <p>
         I am a project-oriented person so making videos to post online is very fulfilling. 
         I’ve created educational material, music videos, gaming content, and more. 
         Throughout my content creation journey, I’ve picked up skills in video 
         editing, photo editing, script writing, audio balancing, and speech.

      <h3>Gaming</h3>
      <p>
        I am a competitive person and gaming/esports is my favorite way 
        to scratch that itch. I’ve participated in competitive communities
        in first person shooters and fighting games. More recently, 
        I’ve taken a backseat in competiting and played a larger role 
        in tournament organization, live commentary, and coaching.
